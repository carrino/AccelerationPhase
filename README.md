# AccelerationPhase

This is used to track the phase of a linear acceleration input.  It was originally written to track the phase of a jump for wearable LED projects.
The primary signal analysis is done with FHT to figure out where in the jump you are.

This code depends on the FHT library found here: http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFHT?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=ArduinoFHT2.zip
